Part Shapley is a project that segments images into identifiable parts and uses Shapley values derived from game theory to calculate the influence of each part on predictions.

## Project Overview

Part Shapley helps in understanding how different parts (e.g., head, body, limbs) of a child's drawing impact the emotional or semantic analysis of the entire picture. This project primarily relies on the calculation of Shapley values from game theory.

## Dataset

We use the 'AI-based Child Art Psychological Diagnosis Drawing Data' dataset. For more information about the dataset, please visit [AIHub](https://www.aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=115&topMenu=100&aihubDataSe=realm&dataSetSn=71399).

## Features

- Segment images into parts and calculate Shapley values for each part.
- Analyze interactions between drawing parts to interpret prediction outcomes.

## Usage

1. Clone the project.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Download the dataset and train the model.
4. Perform Part Shapley calculations.
